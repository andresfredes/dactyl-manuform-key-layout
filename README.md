# dactyl-manuform-key-layout
A custom QMK layout for a 4x5 dactyl manuform

## Layer notes
### Layer 0 - Alpha
- Mod keys primarily on bottom row right hand to avoid accidental mod use when 'rolling' between letters
- Shift mirrored
- Left hand Ctrl on thumb cluster to allow for keyboard and mouse shortcuts (copy / paste etc)
- Most used thumb keys closest to avoid having to stretch hands

### Layer 1 - Navigation
- Left hand arrows, home, end and page scroll
- Right hand mouse control
- Directions set so that UP is on the home row. This is personal preference only
- Volume is available on left hand but rarely used

### Layer 2 - Num / Symbols
- Most used programming symbols on home row
- Num key symbols on bottom row, mirroring their relative number on the top row

### Layer 3 - Gaming / Numpad
- My most used gaming keys on left hand
- Directions on home and bottom row
- Full num pad available on right hand (not currently used often)
- Note: two layer mod buttons to get to this layer. One is toggle (for gaming) and one is hold (for numpad use)

### Layer 4 - Function
- Rarely used, here just in case
- Keyboard reset included to make re-flashing firmware easier
